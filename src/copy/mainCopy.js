  story: "I'm a JavaScript Full Stack Web Developer with a Bachelor's in Computer Animation and Interactive Design with 2 years of under grad Computer Science coursework completed.

Eventually I had a class in Unity, most of the coding was done in C# and that's when the coding bug bit and it hasn't let go since then.",
